Introduction
--------------

``detectmobile.js`` allows you create intelligent mobile redirects in HTTP cache safe manner.

* Mobile detection is based on the screen size: you get "devices smaller than this diameter" which
  is actually the only thing you want to know to send visitors to the small screen optimized site.
  
* detectmobile.js is cache friendly, as it is not doing any cache varying by HTTP user agent header
  or HTTP redirects. Thus, you can safely use any static and anonymous caching with detectmobile.js.
  
The script will take care of the task::

        if user is using a mobile browser and comes to your web site then 
                go to a matching mobile site page
        else
                stay on the web site        
                
With the default settings the script is set up for the following configuration

* Website is hosted in the address like ``www.site.com`` or ``site.com``

* Mobile site is hosted in the address like ``m.site.com``                

Benefits
-------------

Using a Javascript feature based detection over HTTP User-agent header based detection like
`Wurfl <http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/>`_ offers several benefits

* Keep It Simple, Stupid

* Front end caching performance is not destroyed by the need for vary by user agents

* You do not need to maintain huge user agent database (thousands of devices)

* You need minimal amount of server-side code

* Compatible with any programming language or framework (Python, PHP, 
  C#, ASP.NET, Java, even static HTML files...)

Requirements
-------------

You need to be able to control **both** web and mobile site to include detectmobile.js
Javascript in HTML code.
   
Usage
------

The Javascript file must be loaded on *both* web site and mobile site.

It is recommended to have this script as the first script of all Javascripts,
as when the mobile browser comes to website the redirect occurs before
any other media resources are loaded.

::

        <html>
                <head>
                        <script src="http://xxx.com/detectmobile.js"></script>
                        <script>
                                try {
                                        // This is the URL where mobile 
                                        detectmobile.defaultMobileURL = "http://m.xxx.com";
                                        detectmobile.process();                                
                                } catch(e) {
                                        // Make sure that in the fault modes
                                        // we do not interrupt execution of other Javascript code
                                }
                        </script>
                </head>


You can also configure ``detectmobile.redirectCallback()`` function doing 
dynamic mapping of the URLs between mobile site and website pages, so that
when mobile browser arrives to a website it will be redirected to the
corresponding mobile page, `not the site root <http://xkcd.com/869/>`_.

                        <script src="http://xxx.com/detectmobile.js"></script>
                        <script>
                                try {                                        
                                        detectmobile.redirectCallback = function(mode, url) {
                                                if(mode == "mobile") {
                                                        // We could have arrived directly to a news article
                                                        // from a search engine, not the site home page
                                                        // Redirect to a corresponding article mobile version
                                                        
                                                        // This example has some URL path for the article
                                                        // on both site.com and m.site.com, just different domain name.
                                                        // But you could any kind of URL rewrite here. 
                                                        return detectmobile.redirectDomainName(url, "m.site.com");
                                                }
                                                
                                                // Take no action
                                                return url;
                                        }
                                                                                
                                        detectmobile.process();                                
                                } catch(e) {
                                        // Make sure that in the fault modes
                                        // we do not interrupt execution of other Javascript code
                                }
                        </script>
                </head>


Link to the web site
======================

Add the following code to your mobile site to have a backlink to the website.

You need to add ``force-web`` HTTP GET query parameter to create a sticky cookie
which will make the mobile browser stay in the web version.

Use the following code on the mobile site to make browsers go to the full web version::

        <a href="yoursite.com/page?force-web">
                Full website version
        </a>
               
Link to a mobile site
======================

You need to add ``force-mobile`` HTTP GET query parameter to clear any sticky cookies
which will make the mobile browser stay in the web version.

Use the following code on the web site to make browsers go to the mobile web version::

        <a href="m.yoursite.com/page?force-mobile">
                Full site
        </a>        

Further info
====================

See the API documentation.

Compatibility
---------------

All HTML capable mobile browsers are supported.

Opera Mini is supported. 
Other thin clients are also supported if they execute DOM on ready / window loaded Javascript events.   

Impact on the caching
------------------------

The front end caching servers should be configured to ignore the following cookie::

        detectmobile-stick-on-web
        
This cookie is used by Javascript only. Whether it is present or not should not affect the caching.        

Varnish
=======

Below is an example of configuring Varnish to strip out this cookie from the backend requests::

History
-----------

This code was isolated from `Mobilize.js <https://github.com/mobilizejs/mobilize.js>`_.

Tests
------

Below are short instructions for simple manual testing.

Add entry::

        m.localhost 127.0.0.1
        
.. to your */etc/hosts* file (UNIX).        

Start HTTP server in the project folder::

        python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777
        
And then open with desktop browser::

        http://localhost:7777/tests/simple.html        
        
And another::

        http://m.localhost:7777/tests/simple.html        
        
Start iOS emulator and try::
        
        http://localhost:7777/tests/simple.html                
                      
You should end up to *m.localhost:7777/tests/simple.html* via Javascript redirect.
